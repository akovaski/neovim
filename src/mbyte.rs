/// mbyte.c: Code specifically for handling multi-byte characters.
/// Multibyte extensions partly by Sung-Hoon Baek
///
/// Strings internal to Nvim are always encoded as UTF-8 (thus the legacy
/// 'encoding' option is always "utf-8").
///
/// The cell width on the display needs to be determined from the character
/// value. Recognizing UTF-8 bytes is easy: 0xxx.xxxx is a single-byte char,
/// 10xx.xxxx is a trailing byte, 11xx.xxxx is a leading byte of a multi-byte
/// character. To make things complicated, up to six composing characters
/// are allowed. These are drawn on top of the first char. For most editing
/// the sequence of bytes with composing characters included is considered to
/// be one character.
///
/// UTF-8 is used everywhere in the core. This is in registers, text
/// manipulation, buffers, etc. Nvim core communicates with external plugins
/// and GUIs in this encoding.
///
/// The encoding of a file is specified with 'fileencoding'.  Conversion
/// is to be done when it's different from "utf-8".
///
/// Vim scripts may contain an ":scriptencoding" command. This has an effect
/// for some commands, like ":menutrans".

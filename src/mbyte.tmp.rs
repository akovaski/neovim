      2013-05-02 (0.2.8):

        * Use quadratic probing. When the capacity is power of 2, stepping function
          i*(i+1)/2 guarantees to traverse each bucket. It is better than double
          hashing on cache performance and is more robust than linear probing.

          In theory, double hashing should be more robust than quadratic probing.
          However, my implementation is probably not for large hash tables, because
          the second hash function is closely tied to the first hash function,
          which reduce the effectiveness of double hashing.

        Reference: http://research.cs.vt.edu/AVresearch/hashing/quadratic.php

      2011-12-29 (0.2.7):

        * Minor code clean up; no actual effect.

      2011-09-16 (0.2.6):

        * The capacity is a power of 2. This seems to dramatically improve the
          speed for simple keys. Thank Zilong Tan for the suggestion. Reference:

           - http://code.google.com/p/ulib/
           - http://nothings.org/computer/judy/

        * Allow to optionally use linear probing which usually has better
          performance for random input. Double hashing is still the default as it
          is more robust to certain non-random input.

        * Added Wang's integer hash function (not used by default). This hash
          function is more robust to certain non-random input.

      2011-02-14 (0.2.5):

        * Allow to declare global functions.

      2009-09-26 (0.2.4):

        * Improve portability

      2008-09-19 (0.2.3):

        * Corrected the example
        * Improved interfaces

      2008-09-11 (0.2.2):

        * Improved speed a little in kh_put()

      2008-09-10 (0.2.1):

        * Added kh_clear()
        * Fixed a compiling error

      2008-09-02 (0.2.0):

        * Changed to token concatenation which increases flexibility.

      2008-08-31 (0.1.2):

        * Fixed a bug in kh_get(), which has not been tested previously.

      2008-08-31 (0.1.1):

        * Added destructor
